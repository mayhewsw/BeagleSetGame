This is the Beagle Set Playing project

We will be using OpenCV, the DLP pico projector, and the PlayStation Eye.

This is for ECE497: 32-bit Embedded Linux, a class at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology 

Oh dear... how are you supposed to run this?

runner.py:
  -- expects a file called "cameraConfig.cfg" (but doesn't have to be there)
    -- needs to have definitions of hue, brightness, saturation (HSV) values
  -- Other stuff
  
  
  
Warning: the program will talk to you! Search for espeak.
