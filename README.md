## SetGame

Written in Java, using LBJava. 

To Run this project, open eclipse. SetRunner.java is the one you want.

You can also run:

    >> mvn clean
    >> mvn lbj:compile
    >> mvn compile

To clean, run in this order:

    >> mvn lbj:clean
    >> mvn clean

To generate the eclipse files for the project, run

    >> mvn eclipse:eclipse

Hopefully that works correctly?
