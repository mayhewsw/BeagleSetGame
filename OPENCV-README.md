README for Java CPP files.

opencv lives in:
/home/stephen/github/SetGame/opencv

Go to opencv/build:
 > make

Files of interest:
  - ./build/modules/java/highgui.cpp
      Autogenerated! This contains all the CPP from VideoCapture.cpp
  
  - ./modules/java/generator/src/cpp/VideoCapture.cpp
      Contains JNI calls from Java to CPP. This file is actually generated by
      the python file: gen_java.py
      
  - ./build/modules/java/highgui+VideoCapture.java
      Autogenerated!

  - ./build/src/org/opencv/highgui/VideoCapture.java
      Autogenerated!


Now go to this directory (/home/stephen/github/SetGame/opencvjava/lib) and run:
  > copyjavabin.sh
  
  
The problem is that VideoCapture.set(Highgui.CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_{HEIGHT, WIDTH}) isn't working correctly.
These have int values: 

In C++, VideoCapture.{set, get} are defined in: ./modules/highgui/src/cap.cpp
This file creates the CvCapture object. This object has multiple possible implementations. One particular
implementation is chosen using defined variables. Each different implementation defines a "setProperty" 
method. This is what actually "sets the property." We can assume this is working because it works in 
raw C++ code on this machine.

cvSetCaptureProperty is the actual function. This calls CvCapture.setProperty
